            My names are Diego Alejandro and my last names are Albarracin
            Maldonado (quite long, isn't it?) and I am proudly Colombian. I was
            born and raised in a region of the country where there are more cows
            than human beings, to be more exact, in the beautiful and immaculate
            department of Casanare.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am very curious (they used to call me Curious George and Google
            when I was little because they tougth I knew everything), I like to
            learn a little bit of everything and I also enjoy teaching what I
            have learned. On the other hand, in theory, I am preparing to be an
            engineer, however, for many years I have been genuinely interested
            in economics and finance, to the point that my elective subjects in
            my career have been taken from the study plan of the previously
            mentioned programs.
            <br />
            <br />
            To conclude, on this primitive web page you will find more
            information about me and you will be able to discover what I have
            done during the short time (19 years) that I have been inhabiting
            the third planet of the solar system.

            âœ¨ Creating bugs since April 2005.
            <br />
            ðŸ“š I am currently learning more about cloud concepts, financial
            derivatives, and other complex financial concepts.
            <br />
            ðŸŽ¯ Goals: Get my engineering degree in 2026 at the age of 21. Enroll
            in an MBA at a top-tier university in the USA. Become an
            entrepreneur in the near future. Get a Porsche 911 Turbo S. Begin a
            family.
            <br />
            ðŸŽ² Fun facts: I wanted to double major engineering with a finance
            degree (I couldn't do it). I listen to the Minecraft soundtrack when
            I need to focus. I can remember phone numbers, credit card numbers,
            and other combinations with some ease. Watch enthusiast on a budget.

          <p>
            Casanare, located in the eastern region of Colombia, is a department
            known for its rich "llanera" culture and its vast expanse of plains.
            Its capital, Yopal, is an important economic and administrative
            center. Casanare stands out for its oil and agricultural industry,
            with cattle ranching being a prominent traditional activity. Its
            "llanero" landscape, full of savannas and rivers, offers a unique
            natural environment and is home to diverse flora and fauna.
